# Rehowl

> An opinionated React wrapper for Howler.js

<GitHubButton />

üòç Bring-your-own-howl

‚öõ React-friendly API

üßº Written in TypeScript

üîó Built with React Hooks

## Installation

Rehowl has react and howler as peer dependencies so that you can manage your own versions.

```sh
npm install --save-dev howler rehowl
```

```sh
yarn add -D howler rehowl
```

## Quickstart

1. Get a Howl
   - In a function component: [`useHowl`](./?path=/docs/hooks-usehowl--page)
   - In a class component: [`<Rehowl />`](./?path=/docs/components-rehowl--play-pause)
2. Play sounds off the Howl with [`<Play />`](./?path=/docs/components-play--render-play)

## Autoplay Examples

These are just code snippets. To see live examples, [see the Play component documentation](./?path=/docs/components-play--render-play)

### Hook interface

The recommended method to use Rehowl is through its custom hook and `<Play />` element.

Similar to Howler, you initialize a Howl and then can play sounds from it.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useHowl, Play } from 'rehowl'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { howl } = useHowl({
    src: ['sound1.mp3', 'sound1.wav'],
  })
  return <Play howl={howl} />
}
```

### Render props interface

In a class component, you must use the render props pattern with `<Rehowl />`.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Rehowl, Play } from 'rehowl'

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Rehowl src={['sound1.mp3', 'sound1.wav']}>{({ howl }) => <Play howl={howl} />}</Rehowl>
  }
}
```
